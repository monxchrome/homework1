    <p class="history">
        Family life for THE SIMPSONS is a chaotic blend of cheeky outbursts and consequent mending, as Homer
        (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) and Bart (Nancy Cartwright) -- unwittingly or not -- undermine Marge (Julie Kavner)
        and Lisa's (Yeardley Smith) good intentions. Bart finds joy in being a constant source of trouble. Homer earns
        his keep by falling asleep at the controls of Springfield's nuclear plant and drinks beer after work with fellow
        barflies who make the cast of Cheers look tame. But within this dynamic are heartfelt scenes and clever plot
        lines that make THE SIMPSONS a classic.

        Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956 or 1969 or 1977 or 1983)[40] is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series
        (or show). He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight
        (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he
        has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he
        doesn't. He also serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie. Homer Simpson is 39 years old.

        Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson (born April 1[7] or February 23[8]) is the mischievous, rebellious,
        misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is
        the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed
        "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such
        as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series
        entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother,
        Mark Groening.
